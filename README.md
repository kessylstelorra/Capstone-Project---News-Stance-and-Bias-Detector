# Capstone-Project---News-Stance-and-Bias-Detector
This project collects recent news articles related to a chosen topic (e.g., “Trump Tariff”), then uses IBM Granite Instruct, a large language model, to automatically analyze each article’s stance and bias. The final output is a structured dataset summarizing how different media sources portray the topic.
